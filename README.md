# Nandito Ako Lyrics (Python)

A simple Python script that prints the lyrics of the song **"Nandito Ako"** with a timed typewriter animation effect.

## Features

- Displays each line of the lyrics with a smooth typing animation.
- Customizable typing speed and delay after each line.
- Lightweight and uses only standard Python libraries.

## How It Works

The lyrics are stored in a list of tuples:  
```python ```
("line of lyrics", typing_duration, after_delay)

Each line is printed one character at a time based on the typing_duration, then waits for the after_delay before printing the next line.

## How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed (recommended Python 3.x).

Download or clone this repository.

Run the script in your terminal or command prompt:
python nandito_ako.py
